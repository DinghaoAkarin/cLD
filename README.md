# cLD Project
Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is a fundamental concept in genetics; critical for studying genetic associations and molecular evolution. However, LD measurements are only reliable for common genetic variants, leaving low-frequency variants unanalyzed. In this work, we introduce cumulative LD (cLD), a stable statistic that captures the rare-variant LD between genetic regions and opens the door for furthering biological knowledge using rare genetic variants. In application, we find cLD reveals an increased genetic association between genes in 3D chromatin interactions, a phenomenon recently reported negatively by calculating standard LD between common variants. Additionally, we show that cLD is higher between gene pairs reported in interaction databases, identifies unreported protein-protein interactions, and reveals interacting genes distinguishing case/control samples in association studies.
The R&Python code for the cLD project and instructions on how to run it are included in this repository.
